# What?
Yep. This is **The Forest**. Basically a repository made to learn about the Canvas API in Javascript. I really like seeing experiments and how people do incredible things with it. As a developer, I feel so connected to design and interfaces, as well as visual experiences overall. So I'll use this repository to store some knowledge.

# Can I see it?
Sure, just grab the repository and make it shine. Clone it, then:
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

It'll open a browser tab and then magic begins. There's a side menu where you change the contents, and see what every experiment does.
